INFO2350-25S-Sec2 Group 3

Welcome to our AWS project! Our project members are:

Haiyan 
Hyungbum 
Sohrob 
Yeonhwa

Our project is centered around using AWS to achieve deliverables as described in the project requirements provided by the professor. 
We need to create a product with the purpose of achieving automation, outlining an architecture and implementation steps, while discussing security concerns of the environment. Our members have worked and delivered on this, with the final product being this repository and domain:

https://kemdev.com/

This website is intended to host a work portfolio for users/a user. 

Security Concerns:
Entry point for users
Database protection
Securing the web application layer

Resolutions with AWS Services:
AWS WAF to secure the web application layer, acts like a firewall
IAM and network segmentation to protect the database from compromised or unwanted users accessing it
ALB acts as a single entry point for users

These solutions will be expanded in the Word documentation.

Thanks, 
from Group 3.
